ðŸ“¢ Notification Message Builder

building a backend feature for a notification service â€” the system responsible for generating dynamic messages like:

- Email alerts
- SMS notifications
- Push messages

These messages often include:

- The recipient's name
- A timestamp
- The action that triggered the message (e.g., payment, login)
- Dynamic status updates

building user notifications using:

- StringBuilder (for performance)
- StringBuffer (for thread safety)
